      <h1>Experience</h1>

    </p>I studied Computer Generated Imagery at Southampton Solent University for a total of 4 years. I created a small portfolio of personal projects I did over that time that are showcased in the portfolio page <a href="portfolio.html">Here!</a> <br>

    I've mainly worked in hospitality during education both in waitering and bartending, I have to say I do prefer serving beer and cleaning a messy bar instead of becoming road runner and running back and forth from the kitchen with food! <br>

    I'm currently working at Barclays with a technology buisness analyst apprenticeship since August! it's been a blast so far and I'm learning with Multiverse alongside it! </p>
